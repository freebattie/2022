# Folder Structure

## `/examples`

Here you will find examples that you can explore and play around with. Use them as inspiration or as a base for creating your own classes.

## `/object`

Here you will create your own classes, your objects so to speak. 

An example is given that you can use as reference. Remember that you can right click classes (other than the public one named that same as the file) and click Refactor -> Move Class..., doing this will allow you to move your class into its own file.

## `/src`

Here you will find code made during the lecture, and is based on the example found within `object/Example`

## `/task`

Here you will find the README.md which contains different tasks and gives you instructions on what to do. The classes that you create during this task will be used later in later sessions.
